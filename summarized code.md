# Getting rid of unnecessary color

To set up a chart faceted by the city, pass the plotting function the pollution data, map the city to the columns, and make the facet three columns wide.
Use the g.map() function to map a scatterplot() over our grid with the same aesthetic as the original scatter but without the hue argument.
